PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project is based on creating a log in system and making logging easier and more efficient for the    end-user. Users can get so used to typing in their old password that they can forget they changed it. And when they see an error message “Your password is incorrect”, they simply believe that they’re mistyped the password. What users need in this case is a reminder that their password was changed. Instead of giving users a “Your password is incorrect” error message, tell them how long ago they changed their password. This message should only appear when users type in their old password. If users mistyped a password, the system should display a regular ‘Wrong password’ error message.
Another  solution is remember users when they return. All you need to do to enter the website is click on your profile picture or name on the log-in screen.
Most users forget their password. It’s therefore very important that this situation should be well handled by the login process. Login forms should offer a ‘Forgot Password’ link to reset the password.

PROJECT PLAN
1. Create a virtual environment in order to keep your project space running, it’s a good idea to create a virtual environment and keep your dependencies isolated.
In a nutshell, virtual environments allow you to: Maintain dependencies isolated. This avoids situations where you have projects using different package versions and you globally uninstalling/reinstalling what you need every time you need to run a project. Share your dependencies with other people. Once you have installed all the packages that your project needs, you can run: pip freeze > requirements.txt
2. Create a separate directory for tests 
You have heard that creating tests for your code is a good idea. So you’re writing Python code and trying to test it with Pytest.
3. Create different content directories 
Now that you got the idea of creating an _init_.py file, you are good to create as many directories as you want.
4. Document Your Code 
Documenting your code is very important for both future you and other people reading your project.  
There are 3 critical things you should keep in mind:   
i)Add a docstring with a description at the start of each file   
ii)Add a docstring to each function and class   
iii)Use type-hints whenever you define a function or a class
5. Use GitHub for Version Control 
If you are working with someone else, Git + GitHub are essential to do code reviews and to be able to avoid merge conflicts!
